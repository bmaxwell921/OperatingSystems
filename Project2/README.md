Hello!

Included is my Java implementation of the Virtual Memory Project! Use the following steps to build and run it;
shell commands are included for your convenience.

1) Run the included bash file to build the code using:
	./build.sh
*Note* that you'll probably need to make the bash file executable first like this:
	chmod -x build.sh

2) Once the build is complete you can run the program using the following command, replacing <ARGS> with the arguments you want (The bash file will also print this command).
	java -cp ./bin/ edu.iastate.cs352.project2.main.simVm <ARGS>	

Thanks!
